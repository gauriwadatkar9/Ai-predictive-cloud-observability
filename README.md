#  AI Predictive Failure Intelligence System

A dynamic cloud observability platform that predicts system failures before they happen.

This project combines real-time monitoring, AI-driven risk scoring, anomaly clustering, and predictive analytics into a modern, interactive dashboard designed for production-scale environments.

---

## What This Project Solves

Traditional monitoring tools detect failures **after** they occur.

This system focuses on:

- Predicting degradation before outages
- Identifying correlated anomaly clusters
- Visualizing live system risk trends
- Explaining AI decisions transparently
- Providing real-time monitoring insights

It transforms observability from reactive to predictive.
